        <h1 class="title">National Health Mission (NHM) - Improving Healthcare for All</h1>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>The National Health Mission (NHM) is a government initiative launched in 2005 by the Government of India with the primary goal of improving healthcare services in rural and underserved areas of the country. It aims to reduce maternal and child mortality, enhance access to quality healthcare, and strengthen healthcare systems in both urban and rural areas.</p>

            <h2>Key Components of NHM:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A):</strong> This component focuses on reducing maternal and child mortality by improving access to essential health services like antenatal care, institutional deliveries, and immunization programs.</li>
                <li><strong>Communicable Diseases Control:</strong> NHM works to control the spread of diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV/AIDS by providing treatment, creating awareness, and promoting preventive measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Communicable Diseases:</strong> It addresses health issues related to lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cancer through early detection, screening, and treatment.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure Strengthening:</strong> The NHM focuses on strengthening and upgrading health facilities, building new Primary Health Centers (PHCs), Sub-Centers (SCs), and District Hospitals (DHs).</li>
                <li><strong>Human Resources for Health:</strong> NHM aims to increase the availability of qualified healthcare professionals, particularly in underserved and rural areas, by recruiting and training healthcare workers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Objectives of NHM:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To improve the quality and availability of healthcare services, particularly in rural and remote areas.</li>
                <li>To reduce health inequities between urban and rural populations.</li>
                <li>To strengthen the healthcare infrastructure in both public and private sectors.</li>
                <li>To ensure the availability of skilled human resources in health, particularly in underserved areas.</li>
                <li>To implement preventive and promotive health programs for a healthier nation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Achievements:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Significant reduction in maternal and child mortality rates.</li>
                <li>Improvement in immunization coverage, particularly in rural and underserved areas.</li>
                <li>Expansion of healthcare infrastructure, including the establishment of new health facilities.</li>
                <li>Increased availability of essential medicines and diagnostics.</li>
                <li>Enhanced outreach and access to healthcare services, especially for marginalized and vulnerable populations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How NHM Works:</h2>
            <p>NHM is implemented through a decentralized approach involving central, state, and local governments. The central government provides funding and guidance, while the state governments are responsible for the actual implementation of programs. Local governments and healthcare institutions play a crucial role in the delivery of services to the community. The NHM also works in collaboration with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations (CBOs), and other stakeholders to ensure that healthcare services reach those in need.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            <p>The National Health Mission plays a vital role in ensuring that healthcare services reach the most vulnerable and underserved populations in India. Through its comprehensive and integrated approach, NHM has contributed significantly to improving the health and wellbeing of millions of people, especially in rural areas. With continued focus and collaboration among various stakeholders, NHM will contribute to achieving universal health coverage and improving overall public health outcomes in India.</p>
